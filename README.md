# DART: Neural Network-Based Memory Prefetcher

DART (Distilling Attention-based neuRal network to Tables) is a practical implementation of a neural network-based memory prefetcher that uses table-based lookups instead of traditional matrix multiplications. This implementation optimizes for both prediction accuracy and low latency.

Original Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06362

## Features

- Table-based neural network implementation with no matrix multiplications
- SIMD-optimized lookups using AVX2 instructions
- Multi-threaded parallel processing
- Cache-friendly memory layout and prefetching
- Support for complex memory access patterns
- Average prediction latency of ~30-35μs
- Configurable prediction thresholds

## Requirements

### Hardware
- CPU with AVX2 support
- At least 8GB RAM (for full table storage)
- Multiple CPU cores (for parallel processing)

### Software
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- OpenMP support
- Python 3.7+ (for weight generation)

## Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dart-prefetcher.git
cd dart-prefetcher
```

2. Generate the placeholder weights:
```bash
python generate_weights.py
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Configuration

Key parameters can be configured in `include/dart_prefetcher.hpp`:

```cpp
constexpr int SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 8;        // Input sequence length
constexpr int NUM_SEGMENTS = 4;           // Address segments
constexpr int HIDDEN_DIM = 32;           // Hidden dimension
constexpr int NUM_PROTOTYPES = 128;      // Prototypes per table
constexpr int NUM_SUBSPACES = 2;         // Number of subspaces
constexpr int DELTA_BITMAP_SIZE = 64;    // Output bitmap size
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```cpp
#include "dart_prefetcher.hpp"

int main() {
    // Initialize prefetcher
    DARTPrefetcher prefetcher;
    prefetcher.load_weights("path/to/weights");

    // Get predictions for a memory address
    uint64_t current_addr = 0x1000;
    uint64_t current_pc = 0x400500;
    auto predictions = prefetcher.predict(current_addr, current_pc);

    // Process predictions
    for (auto pred_addr : predictions) {
        // Issue prefetch for predicted address
    }
}
```

### SIMD-Optimized Version

```cpp
#include "dart_prefetcher_optimized.hpp"

int main() {
    OptimizedDARTPrefetcher prefetcher;
    // ... same usage as basic version
}
```
